# Odin Library

This project is part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), focused on building a simple library app where you can add, remove, and track books you have read.

## Features
- Add a book to the library with title, author, pages, and read status.
- Toggle the read status of a book.
- Remove books from the library.

**Note:** There is no storage functionality in this project, so any data will be lost once the page is refreshed.
